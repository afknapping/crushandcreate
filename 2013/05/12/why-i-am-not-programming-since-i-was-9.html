      <p>When I was 9 – no, I did <em>not</em> get my first C64. Instead we had a Mac at home. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus">Mac Plus</a> I had spent my initiation with had been replaced with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Macintosh_7100">PowerMac 7100/66</a>. I dabbled around in Illustrator and made crappy icons. </p>
      
      <p>On the Mac Plus I had done some stuff with <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=hypercard">Hypercard</a>. I cannot excatly remember what I worked on – but I specifically remember designing forms for some kind of database. And I wrote <em>functions</em>. Whoa.</p>
      
      <p>Hypercard was fun. It made you create stuff. There was no internet around to download new stacks back then. A couple of examples and a reference on how to do stuff and that was it.</p>
      
      <p>All things were objects with their unique ID: each card, each button, each graphic. Things could animate if I remember correctly. There were <code>mouseDown</code>, <code>mouseUp</code>  and <code>mouseOver</code> events.</p>
      
      <p>However, my Dad brought home the Macworld each month. While Macworld was not so much an programming publication, there were ads in there for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior">Metrowerks CodeWarrior</a>:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>CodeWarrior was a key factor in the success of Apple&#39;s transition of its machine architecture from 68K processors to PowerPC because it provided a complete, solid PowerPC compiler when the competition (Apple&#39;s MPW tools and Symantec C++) was mostly incomplete. Metrowerks also made it easy to generate fat binaries which included both 68K and PowerPC code.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>I talked a couple of times with my dad about CodeWarrior. And then it came. The day that would set me on the path for the next 20 years:</p>
      
      <p>I asked: &ldquo;Dad, can I have a CodeWarrior?&rdquo;<br>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; he asked.<br>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;to program.&rdquo;<br>
      &ldquo;What do you want to program?&rdquo;<br>
      &ldquo;I don&#39;t know yet.&rdquo;<br>
      &ldquo;Well, when you know, ask again and we will see.&rdquo;  </p>
      
      <p>And that was the end of my coding career right there.</p>
      
      <p>Don&#39;t worry, Dad, though. I do not hold any grudges – I know you always did everything with the best intentions. I love you.</p>
      
      <p>But ever since I got back in monospace land, I cannot help but think about that very moment every couple of months. Just for a minute. And for that minute, the question &ldquo;what if&rdquo; is burning.</p>
      
      <p>I mean, if a kid wants pens and paper, you do not ask her/him what he/she is planning to draw, right?</p>
      
      <p>Being a dad myself now, there is only one lesson to learn:  whatever your kids want to do in terms of making, creating, learning: say yes first, ask questions later!</p>
